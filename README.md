## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I've learned a little bit about css grid and flexbox, also about media queries and how to make a website mobile responsive

This is an example of how I use grid to layout my web.
```
#container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
}
```
```
#header {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: 3;
}
```

### Continued development

One of the things that I want continue to develop is my abilities in CSS.
